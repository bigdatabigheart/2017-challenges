# Epilepsy Queensland

## Challenge 1: Diagnosis

Diagnosis of Epilepsy can be a challenge because it is a spectrum. Symptoms can look like day dreaming or being distracted, or appearing to be intoxicated - as well as the dramatic and obvious tonic clonic seizure. How can we raise awareness 

## Challenge 2: Lack of referrals after diagnosis

Persons with epilepsy are frequently diagnosed, and not referred to Epilepsy Queensland. How can we increase referral rates? Or make Epilepsy Queensland more discoverable?

## Challenge 3: Lack of connection / social isolation

Most people with epilepsy do not know others with epilepsy, and experience social isolation. They are dealing with a crucial area of their life without a supportive community. What can be done about this?

## Challenge 4: Lack of age-appropriate resources

The vast majority of diagnoses of epilepsy are before age 6 and after age 65. There is a lack of resources for children, including resources to educate their friends and class mates about their condition. 

## IoT Challenge for Epilepsy Queensland

Many Epileptics now have EEG monitors that capture brainwave information and can be used to collect data and make predictions about epileptic seizures. Most of the damage during an epileptic seizure is due to falling, or colliding with objects. If an epileptic were notified of an impending seizure by a notification, they could get themselves to a safe position.
